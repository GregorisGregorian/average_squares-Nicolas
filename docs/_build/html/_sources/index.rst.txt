.. Sphynx_project documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Sun Nov  9 15:51:41 2025.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

..  The purpose of this documentation is to introduce me to the basics of Sphynx. I will be re-using my previous 
   code which calculates the average of squares of a list of numbers and deleted the whitespaces from input strings.
